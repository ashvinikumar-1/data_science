Pandas is an open source library, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python. Sounds promising!

The DataFrame is one of Pandas' most important data structures. It's basically a way to store tabular data where you can label the rows and the columns. 

With loc and iloc you can do practically any data selection operation on DataFrames you can think of. loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. iloc is integer index based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer.
